DataStructures
==============
Repository contains practice code to create and test common data structures.

How to run unit tests?
----------------------
`unittests.py` module uses Python's in-built `unittest` library. I've added common test cases from initialisation of data structures to object's modifications.

Run below command to test all data structures at once.
```sh
python unittests.py
```

Run command with space-separated class names to test only one or multiple data structures.
```sh
python unittests.py TestLinkedList
```
